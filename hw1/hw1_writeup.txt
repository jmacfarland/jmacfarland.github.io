HW1 WRITEUP
===========================
To be honest, I already know what I like as a developer. I've already spent
several years working for various companies, and I like backend programming.
Server-side stuff just... makes sense. I don't want to become a full-stack
developer, because then you are really locked into a destructive corporate
lifestyle - which is why I am joining the military with a focus on
cybersecurity and (eventually) intelligence operations.

I personally believe that corporations are the single greatest threat to the
American Dream, corrupting it from within by monetizing absolutely everything,
obsessively violating everyone's privacy. Treating people like nothing more
than data structures to be manipulated for financial or political gain.

At this point in my life I do not want to have anything
more to do with them.

That being said, IF I did want to become a fullstack dev, broadness of
knowledge is obviously important. I have a lot of experience with Python,
Mongo, and the Unix environment. HTML/CSS and JS are still important.

If I do go into cybersecurity, it will be necessary to know frontend stuff as
well to assess vulnerabilities. I'm still interested in learning from this class
- I just don't expect it to lead directly to a job or hobby.
