JAMISON MacFarland
HW5 SCRABBLE

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
 - (4) letter tiles selected with proper distribution
 - (4) tiles can be dragged/dropped onto target squares
 - (4) identifies which letter dropped
 - (4) includes bonus squares

 - (3) score kept through multiple rounds until reset (by "reset" button)
 - (2) tiles can only be dragged from rack to board, will bounce back otherwise
      NOTE: kinda janky, take off a point if you want, I guess
 - (2) letters can only be placed next to each other
      NOTE: did not implement disallowing placement, only excluded non-coherent
      words from score calculations. Suggested 1pt deduction?
 - (2) user can restart game (using "restart" button)

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
 - (3) after playing a word, only the number of tiles needed to bring back to 7
      are added to the hand
 - (2) once tile is placed it cannot be moved
      NOTE: prof. discussed this in class... tiles should be movable even after
      being placed, and I am willing to lose two points to stand by that
